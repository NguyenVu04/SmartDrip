# SmartDrip
This project is an IoT-based smart drip irrigation system that automates water distribution for crops based on real-time environmental conditions. Using sensors (soil moisture, temperature, humidity) and AI-driven predictions, the system ensures optimal water usage, reducing waste and improving efficiency.
